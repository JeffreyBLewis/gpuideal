## R package implementing MCMC estimation of the two-parameter IRT model on GPUs

Requires CUDA support to estimate [Clinton, Jackman, and River's (2004)](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos597A/papers/ClintonJackmanRivers2004.pdf) IDEAL model.  

Currently requires the user to edit `src/Makefile` to locate CUDA resources in order to install.
